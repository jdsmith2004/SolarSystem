# Overview

Our project is a game that allows children to get a feel for the solar system around them. While playing, the user can use the directional arrows to change the direction of the rocket and control if it is thrusting or not. As the user travels, they see the different planets and their respective sizes/distances in proper ratio to the actual values in real life. The game also keeps a travel log of where the user has been and how far the user was from the earth as they travelled.

# Future Work
* We could build out the universe to also include the Milky Way and other galaxies
* There is the possibility of giving the rocket the capability to travel at different velocities and also of letting the user decide the settings for how to maneuver the rocket
* When the user arrives at a planet, we could program a little popup to come on the screen giving some facts about the planet and the position of the user
